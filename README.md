# Quirky Portfolio Website 🎨🧩

This is a uniquely designed **frontend portfolio website** that blends creativity, puzzles, and mini-games to showcase my coding innovation and problem-solving skills.  
It was built **prior to the widespread use of AI tools** and before my time as a CS student — highlighting my raw problem-solving approach and experimental spirit.
